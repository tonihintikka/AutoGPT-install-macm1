# AutoGPT-install-macm1
To achieve the goal of installing AutoGPT on an Apple M1 device, the first phase involves obtaining the necessary components. While there are already published browser-based solutions available, I personally did not feel comfortable adding my OpenAI API key to a third-party website. As a result, I aim to create my own local environment on my computer.

To accomplish this, I require my own Google Custom Search Engine and API key, which can be obtained by creating a Google Account and adding a new Search Engine that searches the internet as a whole. I have described the entire process in detail in my repository.

And you can get cx code from your custom search engine url after this

You can also create the API key in this same service

Save both of these for the next phase
