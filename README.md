# AutoGPT-install-macm1
My aim is to get AutoGPT installed to Apple M1 and I Describe the process in this repo

First phase to get the AutoGPT. Of course you can use allready published browser based AutoGPT solutions. Somehow i didn't find confortable to add my OpenAi API key to some random website. I could be that the website does nothing to my APIKeys but it also could be other way. I just want to run environment to my computer.

It seems that I need my own Google Custom Search Engine and API key. You need a Google Account for this but just add new Search Engine that search all over the Internet.
